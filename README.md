### Edit by Bella:

Finz0 got mad after TigerMouthBear (relevant person who continued Ares client and helped with Backdoored client) created this issue: https://github.com/FINZ0/Osiris/issues/55

So now the original repo is private.

It is perfectly legal to release this code as it is licensed under LGPL, as described and fixed in this pull request which was merged: https://github.com/FINZ0/Osiris/pull/48
